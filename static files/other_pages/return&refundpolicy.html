Return and Refund Policy
Solar Taxi Ltd ("Solar Taxi") is committed to providing high-quality electronic vehicles to our customers. This Return and Refund Policy outlines our procedures for processing refunds in various scenarios.

Eligibility
Refunds shall not be issued seven (7) days after an order being placed and an initial down payment made. Orders must be carefully reviewed before final confirmation.

In cases of client dissatisfaction stemming from a discernible defect in the delivered product, Solar Taxi assumes responsibility for rectification, including the replacement of any faulty parts. Clients retain the option to initiate a refund request; however, reimbursement will be capped at 80% of the purchase price if the defect is attributed to Solar Taxi's manufacturing or assembly processes. Solar Taxi shall bear the costs associated with repairing the defect and replacing any necessary parts. Should the client remain unsatisfied despite remedial efforts, Solar Taxi commits to issuing an 80% refund to the client.
In circumstances where prototype products are exhibited to the client and upon receipt, they conform precisely to the presented samples, the client shall be ineligible for a refund unless there exists a defect arising from manufacturing or assembly processes.
Solar Taxi Ltd does not offer exchanges. Clients must follow the prescribed return process and place a new order.
All used products are ineligible for a refund and return.
A client shall only be eligible for a refund upon making available a proof of payment/ receipt of the said product.

Process
The initial step in initiating a return or refund is to contact Solar Taxi's Customer Support team. Customer Support shall assess the request and refer the matter to the appropriate body for further review and follow-up.
Items sent to any of the manufacturer's offices without prior approval will be declined and may not be returned to the sender.
Any product being returned must be requested and approved through the Solar Taxi Returns Process.
Refunds are processed to eligible parties within 30 to 90 on a case- by- case basis.
